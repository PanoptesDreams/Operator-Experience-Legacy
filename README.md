# Argus Operator eXperience

This is achieved by placing known applications and data into an appropriate directory within the hierarchy, making them more accessible through logical storage.

A dedicated Drive or Volume, everything will go here (unless specified otherwise by the operator)





## Nomenclature
*Noun* choosing of names for things, especially in a science

Nomenclature has evolved over time with societal growth and so it shall in the tech industry as well.

Some of the names we used in the past were based on human atrocities and are no longer appropriate in the modern age. Below are our adopted preferred replacement terms.

These are subject to change based on what the community adopts or how other terms evolve or become repurposed.
