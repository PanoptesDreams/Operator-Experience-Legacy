## Nomenclature

*Noun* - choosing of names for things, especially in a science.

Nomenclature has evolved over time with societal growth and so it shall in the tech industry as well.

Some of the names we used in the past were based on human atrocities and are no longer appropriate in the modern age. Below are our adopted preferred replacement terms.

These are subject to change based on what the community adopts or how other terms evolve or become repurposed.
